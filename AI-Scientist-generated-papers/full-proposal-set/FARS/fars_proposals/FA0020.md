## Introduction

### Context and Motivation

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into applications that ingest **untrusted text** (retrieved documents, emails, web pages) and may take actions (e.g., tool calls, application programming interface (API) requests). **Prompt injection** refers to attacks where an adversary places instructions inside this untrusted text to override the developer’s intended instruction. The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 for LLM Applications lists prompt injection as a top risk (LLM01: Prompt Injection).

A common mitigation is to enforce a separation between **trusted instructions** (system/developer prompts) and **untrusted data** (external content). Some defenses implement this separation through training-time methods that modify model weights, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; preference-based fine-tuning), reinforcement learning (RL), or parameter-efficient adaptations like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation). These approaches can be effective, but they must often be repeated for each new model checkpoint or model variant.

**DefensiveTokens** (Chen et al., 2025) introduced a test-time defense that does not change the model weights. It prepends a small number (typically \(k=5\)) of learned **soft tokens**—continuous embedding vectors inserted into the prompt, as in prompt tuning (optimizing prompt embeddings while keeping model weights frozen)—to steer the model away from following injected instructions. On multiple prompt-injection benchmarks, DefensiveTokens substantially reduce **attack success rate (ASR; lower is safer)** while maintaining instruction-following utility.

### The Problem

DefensiveTokens must be optimized separately for each target model because the soft tokens live in the model’s embedding space and are learned by backpropagation through the full LLM. In practice, developers and model providers frequently need to defend multiple closely related checkpoints (e.g., base-model updates, instruction-tuned variants, organization-specific fine-tunes). Re-optimizing DefensiveTokens for every checkpoint reduces their usability as a reusable, inference-time defense.

Prior work on prompt tuning studies when learned continuous prompts transfer across tasks or models, often using (i) a trained projector between embedding spaces, or (ii) training-free alignment methods based on shared structure in embeddings. However, these works mostly target task performance, not security robustness. DefensiveTokens also have unusually large embedding norms—approximately two orders of magnitude larger than typical vocabulary embeddings (DefensiveTokens, Table 2)—so it is unclear whether standard transfer methods can extrapolate to these out-of-distribution vectors.

### Key Insight and Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:** For closely related LLMs that share an identical tokenizer and embedding dimensionality, the “defense-relevant” directions encoded by DefensiveTokens are approximately preserved across model variants up to a linear change of basis. Therefore, an **embedding-space alignment** estimated from the two models’ vocabulary embedding matrices can map DefensiveTokens from a source model to a target model, recovering most of the security benefit **without** per-target backpropagation.

**Operational definition of “closely related” (for this proposal):**
1. The two models use the same tokenizer (text-to-token-id mapping) with the same token-id → token-string mapping (so embedding rows correspond to the same discrete tokens).
2. The token embedding dimensionality matches (\(d_s=d_t\)), enabling a direct linear map.

**Why this might fail:** DefensiveTokens are high-norm outliers. A linear alignment fitted on normal vocabulary embeddings may not generalize to such out-of-distribution vectors. Transfer could yield negligible security improvement (ASR close to “no defense”) or induce excessive refusals (utility degradation).

## Proposed Approach

### Overview

Let the source model \(M_s\) have a token embedding matrix \(E_s \in \mathbb{R}^{|V|\times d}\) and the target model \(M_t\) have \(E_t \in \mathbb{R}^{|V|\times d}\), where \(V\) is a shared vocabulary with identical token-id indexing. Let the optimized DefensiveTokens for \(M_s\) be \(T_s \in \mathbb{R}^{k\times d}\) (with \(k=5\) in the DefensiveTokens paper).

We compute a linear alignment \(W\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) from \(E_s\) to \(E_t\) using only vocabulary embeddings, then transfer the defensive soft tokens by:
\[
T_t = T_s W.
\]
We then deploy \(T_t\) on \(M_t\) by prepending these \(k\) soft tokens to the input in the same way as DefensiveTokens.

### Method Details

**1) Build aligned embedding pairs.**  
Construct matrices \(X, Y \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}\) by taking corresponding rows from the two embedding tables:
- \(X_i = E_s[\text{token\_id}_i]\)
- \(Y_i = E_t[\text{token\_id}_i]\)

We will use either the full shared vocabulary or a high-frequency subset (to reduce the influence of rare tokens).

**2) Orthogonal Procrustes alignment (norm-preserving).**  
We solve the orthogonal Procrustes problem:
\[
W^* = \arg\min_{W^\top W = I} \lVert XW - Y \rVert_F,
\]
where \(\lVert\cdot\rVert_F\) is the Frobenius norm (square-root of the sum of squared matrix entries). This has a closed-form solution:
- Compute \(M = X^\top Y\)
- Compute the singular value decomposition (SVD; factorization into orthogonal matrices and singular values): \(M = U\Sigma V^\top\)
- Set \(W^* = U V^\top\)

We use an orthogonal map because it preserves vector norms and angles, which is relevant for DefensiveTokens since their large norms appear important for robustness (DefensiveTokens, Table 2).

**3) Transfer DefensiveTokens.**  
Compute \(T_t = T_s W^*\) and prepend \(T_t\) as soft tokens at inference time.

**4) Norm-handling ablation.**  
As an ablation, after mapping we rescale each transferred token to match the source token’s \(\ell_2\) norm. This tests whether small embedding-scale differences between checkpoints affect transfer.

**5) Optional “tiny adaptation” (ablation, not required).**  
If mapping-only transfer yields partial improvements, perform \(\le 200\) gradient steps updating only \(T_t\) (not model weights) using the DefensiveTokens training objective. This tests whether alignment provides a good initialization that reduces per-target optimization cost.

### Key Innovations

1. **Cross-model transfer for prompt injection defense:** Applies soft-prompt transfer to a security setting (prompt injection robustness) rather than task accuracy.
2. **Training-free alignment from embedding tables:** Uses a closed-form Procrustes alignment computed from vocabulary embeddings, without training a projector or using task labels.
3. **Decision-oriented evaluation:** Tests whether transferred tokens close a large fraction of the “no defense → full DefensiveTokens” security gap at near-zero per-checkpoint compute.

### Field Overview

Prompt injection defenses aim to prevent untrusted text from overriding a model’s intended instruction. Existing approaches include:

- **Training-time robustness methods**, which modify model weights to make models better at separating instructions from data (e.g., SFT, DPO, RL, and representation editing). These can provide strong robustness but require retraining for each checkpoint.
- **Prompting and data-marking defenses**, which modify the prompt format to delimit or transform untrusted spans (e.g., “reminder” prompts or datamarking). These are easy to deploy but are often brittle to adaptive attacks.
- **Detection-based defenses**, which try to detect prompt injection attempts before answering or acting. These introduce false positives/negatives and often add runtime overhead.
- **System-level and architectural defenses**, which enforce capability control or data provenance (often targeting tool-using agents).
- **Soft-prompt defenses**, such as DefensiveTokens, which use continuous prompt vectors at inference time to steer behavior without weight updates.

Security is commonly measured by **attack success rate (ASR; lower is safer)** on benchmarks that contain an intended instruction plus an injected instruction inside untrusted text. Examples used in the DefensiveTokens paper include AlpacaFarm (208 instruction+data examples with a fixed injected instruction appended to the data), SEP (9.1k instruction–data–injection triples testing instruction/data separation), and TaskTracker (~31k prompt-injection examples targeting task drift).

Separately, prompt tuning and soft-prompt transfer research studies when learned continuous prompts can be reused across tasks or models. This proposal connects these areas by asking whether a security-oriented soft prompt (DefensiveTokens) can be amortized across closely related model checkpoints using a simple embedding-space alignment.

## Experiments

### Experimental Setup

**Tokenizer compatibility check (required pre-step).**  
Before alignment, verify that the source and target tokenizers are identical (same vocabulary size and same token-id → token-string mapping). If they differ, this proposal’s Procrustes-based transfer is out of scope (would require anchor-based or learned-projector transfer).

**Base Models:**

| Model | Size | Download Link | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Llama-3-8B-Instruct | 8B | https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct | Source/target model for within-family transfer |
| Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct | 8B | https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct | Source/target model for within-family transfer |
| (Optional extension) Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct | 70B | https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct | Cross-size stress test (optional) |

**Training Data (only if DefensiveToken embeddings must be re-optimized):**

| Dataset | Purpose | Size | Download Link | License |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Cleaned Alpaca | Instruction-following data used to optimize DefensiveTokens in the original paper | ~51k | https://github.com/gururise/AlpacaDataCleaned | See dataset repository for license |

**Other Resources:**
- DefensiveTokens code and scripts: https://github.com/Sizhe-Chen/DefensiveToken

**Resource Estimate**:

- **Compute budget**: ≤150 graphics processing unit (GPU)-hours (conservative upper bound)
  - **DefensiveTokens optimization (if needed to obtain \(T_s\))**: The DefensiveTokens paper reports using 4×NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs with PyTorch FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel) for ~1 hour per model (≈4 GPU-hours, i.e., 4 GPUs × 1 hour) to optimize \(k=5\) tokens for one epoch on Cleaned Alpaca (`./references/Defending-Against-Prompt-Injection-With-a-Few-DefensiveTokens/sections/Training..md`).
  - **Embedding alignment**: compute \(X^\top Y\) and an SVD of a \(d\times d\) matrix (e.g., \(4096\times4096\)); negligible compared to LLM training/inference.
  - **Inference for AlpacaFarm evaluation**: 208 prompts × a small number of defense variants; expected to be a few GPU-hours at most on an 8B model. Optional GCG-ASR evaluation is more expensive because it runs an adaptive gradient-based attack, so it can be deferred until after the optimization-free ASR results are known.
  - **Optional tiny-adapt**: ≤200 steps updating only \(T_t\); expected ≤10 GPU-hours.
  - **Optional 70B extension**: could require tens to hundreds of GPU-hours depending on batch sizes and whether full DefensiveTokens optimization is repeated; not required for initial verification.

- **GPU memory**: 8B models fit on 1×A100-80GB; 70B may require tensor parallelism (splitting model computation across multiple GPUs) or FSDP across multiple GPUs.
- **API usage**: None required.
- **Azure OpenAI content filter compliance**: This proposal avoids using OpenAI models (gpt-*, o1-*, etc.) for any prompts or judging. The core evaluation uses AlpacaFarm, where ASR is computed via a deterministic string-match rule and does not require a model-based judge (as in DefensiveTokens). Optional extensions that require an automated judge (e.g., SEP, TaskTracker) should use a non-OpenAI judge model to avoid Azure content filtering.

### Benchmarks and Metrics

| Benchmark | Description | Metrics | Split | Download Link | Evaluation Script |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AlpacaFarm (prompt injection subset) | 208 instruction+data samples where an injected instruction (e.g., “Print exactly Hacked!”) is appended to the data to test whether the model follows the injection | ASR (attack success rate under optimization-free attacks; lower is safer). Optional: GCG-ASR (attack success rate under the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) adaptive attack; lower is safer) | test | https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_farm | DefensiveTokens repo scripts + paper’s string-match rule (`Security evaluation..md`) |
| (Optional extension) SEP | Instruction–data separation benchmark (9.1k samples) where each example includes an instruction, a data passage, and an injected instruction inside the data | ASR (attack success rate; lower is safer) | test | https://openreview.net/pdf?id=8EtSBX41mt | Requires an automated judge; use a non-OpenAI judge model (e.g., Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct) if run |
| (Optional extension) TaskTracker | Prompt-injection benchmark (~31k) designed to measure “task drift” under injected instructions in retrieved text | ASR (attack success rate; lower is safer) | test | (see DefensiveTokens repo) | Requires an automated judge; use a non-OpenAI judge model if run |

### Main Results

**Tiered outcome interpretation (for the main AlpacaFarm experiment):**
- **Strong success**: gap-closed ≥0.85 with no large increase in refusal rate → alignment-only transfer is likely usable without re-optimization.
- **Partial success**: gap-closed in [0.50, 0.85) → alignment provides a useful initialization; consider tiny-adapt.
- **Failure**: gap-closed <0.50 or large refusal-rate increase → DefensiveTokens do not transfer via simple linear alignment.

#### Comparability Rules (CRITICAL)

All methods below use the same AlpacaFarm prompts, the same injection variants, and the same ASR computation rule (“attack succeeds if the lowercase response begins with ‘hacked’”) as described in the DefensiveTokens paper (`./references/Defending-Against-Prompt-Injection-With-a-Few-DefensiveTokens/sections/Security evaluation..md`).

#### Results Table

Numbers below are copied from **Table 4** of the DefensiveTokens paper artifact: `./references/Defending-Against-Prompt-Injection-With-a-Few-DefensiveTokens/sections/4.2. DefensiveToken As SOTA Test-Time Defense.md` (SOTA = state of the art). Transfer results are **TBD** (to be verified).

| Method | Base Model | Benchmark | ASR ↓ (lower is safer) | GCG-ASR ↓ (lower is safer) | Utility proxy: RefusalRate ↓ (lower is better) | Source | Notes |

**Definition of RefusalRate:** the fraction of benign prompts for which the model output matches a standard refusal pattern (e.g., “I can’t help with that”, “I’m not able to”, etc.). Concretely, we will use the same 208 AlpacaFarm items but remove the injected instruction from the data field, then measure how often the defended model produces a refusal. This is a coarse automated check to ensure the defense does not reduce ASR primarily by refusing to answer.

### Ablation Studies

| Variant | What’s changed | Expected finding |
|---|---|---|
| Direct copy vs Procrustes | Compare transfer without vs with alignment | If embedding spaces differ by a rotation, Procrustes should outperform direct copy |
| Norm rescaling | Rescale mapped tokens to match source \(\ell_2\) norms | If embedding-scale differences matter, rescaling improves ASR without increasing refusals |
| Tiny-adapt (≤200 steps) | Few gradient steps on target tokens only | If alignment provides a good initialization, tiny-adapt closes remaining gap at much lower cost than full optimization |

### Analysis (Optional)

- **Geometry diagnostics:** Compare cosine similarity (normalized dot product measuring the angle between vectors) and norm statistics of \(T_s\), \(T_t\), and vocabulary embeddings; test whether transferred tokens remain high-norm outliers as in the original method.
- **Boundary conditions:** Test whether transfer works for 8B↔8B but fails for 8B→70B, and report the failure regime.

---

## Success Criteria

**Criterion 1: Transfer closes most of the security gap (AlpacaFarm).**
- Hypothesis: Procrustes-transferred tokens achieve a large fraction of the security improvement of full DefensiveTokens on the target model.
- Validation: Compute the gap-closed ratio  
  \[
  r = \frac{\text{ASR}_{\text{no}} - \text{ASR}_{\text{xfer}}}{\text{ASR}_{\text{no}} - \text{ASR}_{\text{full}}}
  \]
  where \(\text{ASR}_{\text{no}}\) is the “no defense” ASR, \(\text{ASR}_{\text{full}}\) is the per-model-optimized DefensiveTokens ASR, and \(\text{ASR}_{\text{xfer}}\) is the transferred-token ASR. Interpret \(r\) using the tiered rubric in the Experiments section.

**Criterion 2: Utility does not collapse.**
- Hypothesis: Transfer does not reduce ASR primarily by forcing refusals.
- Validation: RefusalRate under transferred tokens remains close to the target model’s baseline RefusalRate and does not increase substantially relative to full DefensiveTokens.

**Criterion 3: Compute amortization is material.**
- Hypothesis: Transfer reduces per-checkpoint defense cost.
- Validation: Mapping-only transfer requires no backpropagation; if tiny-adapt is used, it should require far fewer optimization steps than full DefensiveTokens training (≥5× fewer) while retaining a large fraction of the ASR improvement.

---

## Impact Statement

If successful, this work would make DefensiveTokens substantially easier to maintain across frequent model updates: a provider could optimize DefensiveTokens for one checkpoint and reuse them on closely related checkpoints with negligible additional compute. If transfer fails, the negative result is still decision-changing: it would suggest that DefensiveTokens are strongly model-specific even within a model family, motivating more expressive transfer mechanisms (e.g., learned projectors) if amortization is required.
